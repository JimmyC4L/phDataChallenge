# PhData Challenge
The customer runs a website and periodically is attacked by a botnet in a Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack. Youâ€™ll be given a log file in Apache log format from a given attack. Use this log to build a simple real-time detector of DDOS attacks. 

#### Requirements
- Ingest
    - Read a file from local disk and write to a message system such as Kafka.
 - Detection
   - Write an application which reads messages from the message system and detects whether the attacker is part of the DDOS attack
   - Once an attacker is found, the ip-address should be written to a results directory which could be used for further processing
   - An attack should be detected one to two minutes after starting

#### Tech

* Spring Boot
* Spring Kafka
* Spring AWS
* MySql

#### Running the application 

Install Kafka and start a zookeeper server for Kafka.

```sh
$ cd your-kafka-directory
$ bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
```

Start the Kafka server

```sh
$ bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
```

Run the spring app

```sh
$ gradle bootRun
```
#### Using the app
Use the following curl statement or use Postman to start processing
 - read log file and sent it to kafka 
 - read the messages from kafka and find the attackers 
 - store all results to MySql database 
 - generate a Json file and uploade it to S3 bucket.

Use the following curl statement or Postman to Store file into S3 bucket (Replace the file path to the file path you want to uploade)
```
curl -X POST \
